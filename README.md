Welcome to this amazing website dedicated to walks and events for dogs, which aims to create an environment where owners are not forced to join social groups to have an amazing way to let their dogs interact.

![Website Highlights]()

bugs/problems
if statements
can't manage to redirect after registration

main researches for features have been: signals, ajax(js), forms mostly from documentations and google researches

FOR LOGIN-LOGOUT-REGISTER I followed the course pages and used the same templates.

NOT well designed stuff:
dog modify/delete
footer
styling all over
display name instead of user name in events details
limit the max "join" to the number of dogs owned. Display remove only if you joined already. limit remove to the additions you put.
